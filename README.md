## Section CSV Columns

```txt
id,sectionName,className,title,sortOrder,enabled,members
```

Rows with an `id` update that section document using merge. Rows without an `id` create a new section.
Use `email:role` pairs separated by semicolons in `members`, such as `teacher@example.com:admin;parent@example.com:viewer`.

The homepage queries `members` with `array-contains-any` using the signed-in lowercase email and the `admin`/`viewer` roles. The matching rules are in `firestore.rules`, based on the supplied project rules. Publish that file in the Firebase console's Firestore Rules tab for `eschool-dev-4c6b4` to apply the correction. The section membership helper uses a map `in sectionData.members`; the previous `members is list` and `hasAny()` expression denied the query in emulator verification. A school-admin marker alone does not grant section read access under these rules.

The submissions page loads classrooms owned by the signed-in UID and classrooms in sections where that email has the `admin` role. Submissions are queried by each owned classroom's document ID and each administered section's ID, then deduplicated. A viewer membership alone does not grant submission review access. Owner access requires submissions to reference the classroom document ID; historical class-code references need an authorized `sectionId` to appear through section-admin access. Deletion is disabled because the supplied rules forbid deleting submissions. Date filters initially show today; widen the range to see older results. Failed loads display an error instead of an empty result.

To verify section access against an isolated local Firestore emulator, run `FIRESTORE_RULES_TEST_HOST=127.0.0.1:8190 node --test tests/firestore-rules.test.js`. This test installs the rules and writes fixtures only to the emulator's `demo-section-rules` project.

## Student CSV Columns

```txt
id,studentName,phone,enabled
```

Student imports are scoped to the section currently open in the admin UI. Rows with an `id` update that student document using merge. Rows without an `id` create a new student.

The student create/edit form shows the Firestore document ID. Leave it blank when creating a student to auto-generate an ID, or enter a custom ID for a new student. Existing student IDs are read-only while editing.

## Classroom CSV Columns

```txt
id,classCode,className,sectionId,sectionName,questionBankListId,randomQuestionTypeCounts,studentDifficultyLevels,classEnabled,createdBy,creatorId,createdAt,createdDate
```

The classroom page reads all documents from `/classrooms`, shows creator email, created time, question randomization counts, and student difficulty overrides, and sorts newest classrooms first.

## Submissions Admin

The submissions page reads all documents from `qb_quiz_submissions_v1`, joins them with `/classrooms` by classroom document ID, class code, or section ID fallback, and filters by a From/To date range (inclusive, both default to today; clear either to leave that side open).

## Student Records

The `students.html` page lists every answer from `qb_quiz_submissions_v1` in one table: Question, Teacher's Answer, and Student's Answer. A small line under each question shows the student, section, subject, and date. The student's answer is green when correct and red when wrong.

Filters: search (student, admission no, question), section, class, subject, question type, question verified state, and a From/To date range. Results show 100 at a time with **Show more**. **Export CSV** downloads the filtered rows with the columns `Student ID` (admission number), `Question ID`, `Subject`, `Question`, `Correct Answer`, and `Student Answer`.

Class, subject, verified state, MCQ option text, and current short-answer model answers come from `qb_questions_v1`, because most submissions do not store class or subject. To limit reads, that question data is cached in the browser's `localStorage` for 12 hours; **Refresh** reloads it.

## Question Moderation

The questions page reads `qb_questions_v1` and `qb_reactions_v1`, computes like/dislike counts client-side, and supports bulk setting or removing `verified`. Bulk delete shows a detailed preview before deleting selected question documents.

Question moderation supports CSV import/export, table columns, filters, and sorting for `skill`, `actfl_level`, `actfl_sublevel`, and `actfl_mode`.

A **Parameters** column next to Explanation URL shows `explanationParameters`, the query string for the explanation link (such as `a=2&b=-5`). Its **Open** link opens the explanation URL with the parameters applied. It is included in CSV import/export, with no filter or sorting.

### Importing translations

Question import reads translations from per-language columns: `Hindi Question`, `Hindi Options`, `Hindi Answer`, `Hindi Explanation`, and the same four for Telugu. Options are separated by `|`. Blank cells are skipped, so a partial file never clears stored translations.

If your file has a single `Translations` column holding JSON (as in the CSV export), convert it first:

```bash
npm run split-translations -- path/to/questions.csv [output-folder]
```

This writes two files next to the input (or into the output folder):

- `<name>-import.csv`: `ID`, `Explanations` (when present) and the Hindi and Telugu columns, ready to import on the Questions page.
- `<name>-held.csv`: translations left out because they look scrambled, with the reason, such as text in the wrong language, an answer that is part of the question, an explanation that is only an option letter, or an explanation much shorter than the English one. Held entries stay blank in the import file, so the import keeps what is already stored. Fix them and run the converter again.

Only Hindi and Telugu are converted; other languages in the JSON are ignored.

Questions can be filtered by type (MCQ, short answer, fill in the blank, true/false), complete translations (every language has its question, answer and explanation), and the distinct, non-empty `sectionId` values on loaded question documents. The Correct Answer column shows the answer already stored on each question: the option marked correct for MCQs, `shortAnswerHtml` for short answers, `trueAnswer` for true/false, and the accepted `fibBanks` answers for fill in the blank.

## Taxonomy Moderation

The taxonomy page reads `qb_taxonomy_v1` and `qb_questions_v1`, supports bulk setting or removing `verified`, CSV export, CSV paste/file import with preview, previewed deletes, and two-column taxonomy merge mapping with include/exclude filters. Merge maps selected source IDs to compatible target IDs, updates matching question reference fields, and deletes only the old source taxonomy documents.

Taxonomy CSV columns:

```txt
id,type,label,parentId,verified
```

## Admin Access

The app contains an optional `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist in `app.js`. Leave it empty for any signed-in Google user during development, or add lowercase admin emails:

```js
const ADMIN_EMAILS = ['admin@example.com'];
```

For production security, deploy Firestore rules that authorize admins server-side, such as a `/schoolAdmins/{uid}` marker document.

## Using Your Own Firebase Project

All pages read their config from `firebase-config.js`, which defaults to the team project. To use your own project, copy `firebase-config.local.example.js` to `firebase-config.local.js` (git-ignored) and paste your web app config. Enable Google sign-in and Firestore in that project, and add `localhost` to its authorized domains.

To seed it, open `copy-data.html`, sign in to both projects, pick collections, and copy. Document IDs are kept; same-ID documents in your project are overwritten.

## Run Locally

Use Node.js 22 or newer. Keep the service account JSON outside the repository, then run from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/absolute/path/to/service-account.json"
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and sign in with Google. No Cloud Functions deployment is needed. Account operations require an active `/schoolAdmins/{uid}` marker or `role: admin` claim. See [setup instructions](STUDENT_AUTH_DEPLOYMENT.md) for credential permissions and rules. `npm test` runs mock Firebase tests without changing live data.

## Student Firebase Accounts

The student form supports school email (login username), admission number, account creation, password reset, and disabling linked accounts. **Migrate Login Profiles** backfills UID-keyed profiles for existing linked students. Student CSV adds `email,admissionNo`; passwords are excluded. See [deployment and migration instructions](STUDENT_AUTH_DEPLOYMENT.md) before using these controls.

**Bulk Create Accounts** downloads a CSV template for unlinked students in the open section. Fill `id,email,password,admissionNo`, preview it, and create accounts with per-student results. Existing linked accounts are skipped without password resets. Account CSV files contain initial credentials and should be kept private.
