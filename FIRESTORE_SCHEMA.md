# Firestore Schema

The teacher dashboard reads classroom and quiz submission data. It can create and update classrooms owned by the signed-in teacher. The separate admin pages manage class sections, section rosters, section access roles, classrooms across all users, and all quiz submissions.

## Firebase Auth

Teachers sign in with Google. The app uses the signed-in Firebase Auth UID to find classrooms:

```txt
classrooms where creatorId == currentUser.uid
```

The classroom admin list reads all classroom documents:

```txt
classrooms
```

The submissions admin list reads all quiz submission documents:

```txt
qb_quiz_submissions_v1
```

## Collections

### `classrooms`

Path:

```txt
/classrooms/{classroomId}
```

Document shape:

```js
{
  classCode: '176260',
  classEnabled: true,
  className: 'DSS grade 8 aug 31 quiz',
  createdBy: '',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  createdDate: 1788177950135,
  creatorId: 'SPwA523UClVxTpX5m8XPMu5Imiy1',
  sectionId: 'QQAP9O4UyvlaYhqz7jdE',
  sectionName: 'DSS grade 8',
  questionBankListId: 'qb_lists_v1 document id',
  randomQuestionTypeCounts: {
    mcq: 10,
    fib: 5,
    short_answer: 3,
    true_false: 2
  },
  studentDifficultyLevels: {
    '102': 'Easy',
    '103': 'Hard'
  },
  studentDifficultyUpdatedAt: Timestamp,
  archived: false,
  archivedAt: Timestamp,
  archivedBy: 'firebase-auth-uid',
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

Important fields:

- `creatorId` - must match the signed-in teacher UID for the teacher dashboard. The admin classroom list shows classrooms from all creators and displays this value.
- `createdBy` - creator email shown in the admin classroom list when available.
- `createdAt` - shown as a human-readable timestamp in the admin classroom list. Classrooms are sorted newest first using `createdAt`, then `createdDate`.
- `classCode` - shown in classroom cards and used as a submission lookup fallback.
- `classEnabled` - shown as enabled/disabled.
- `sectionId` - used as a submission lookup fallback for all students in the classroom section.
- `sectionName` - shown in the dashboard.
- `questionBankListId` - optional reference to a private question list selected by the teacher.
- `randomQuestionTypeCounts` - optional per-type limits for randomly picking questions from the selected question list. Missing or empty means use all questions.
- `studentDifficultyLevels` - optional admission-number keyed difficulty overrides. Missing student entries use the quiz session default question selection.
- `studentDifficultyUpdatedAt` - optional timestamp for the last student difficulty override update.
- `archived` - optional soft archive flag. Teachers can archive and unarchive quiz sessions they created.
- `archivedAt` - optional timestamp for when the quiz session was archived or unarchived.
- `archivedBy` - optional Firebase Auth UID for the user who last changed the archive state.
- `updatedAt` - optional timestamp for the last classroom update.

Admin deletion behavior:

- Bulk deleting classrooms deletes selected `/classrooms/{classroomId}` documents.
- It also deletes matching `qb_quiz_submissions_v1` documents found by `classroomId == classroom.id`, `classroomId == classroom.classCode`, or `sectionId == classroom.sectionId`.

### `classSections`

Path:

```txt
/classSections/{sectionId}
```

The classroom editor loads section documents for the create/edit dropdown:

```txt
classSections
```

Supported display fields:

```js
{
  sectionName: 'DSS grade 8',
  name: 'DSS grade 8',
  className: 'DSS grade 8',
  title: 'DSS grade 8',
  sortOrder: 0,
  enabled: true,
  members: [
    {
      email: 'teacher@example.com',
      role: 'admin'
    },
    {
      email: 'viewer@example.com',
      role: 'viewer'
    }
  ],
  createdBy: 'admin@example.com',
  updatedBy: 'admin@example.com',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  createdDate: 1788177950135
}
```

Section admin access:

- `members` - array of email/role assignments for the section.
- `members[].email` - normalized lowercase email.
- `members[].role` - either `viewer` or `admin`.
- Section CSV import/export represents members as semicolon-separated `email:role` pairs, for example `teacher@example.com:admin;viewer@example.com:viewer`.

The selected option is saved into classrooms as:

```js
{
  sectionId: 'existing section value',
  sectionName: 'DSS grade 8'
}
```

Section rosters are read from:

```txt
/classSections/{sectionId}/students/{studentDocId}
```

Student document shape:

```js
{
  studentName: 'Parunandi Sai Adithya',
  name: 'Parunandi Sai Adithya',
  phone: '8328303045',
  enabled: true,
  createdBy: 'admin@example.com',
  updatedBy: 'admin@example.com',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  createdDate: 1788177950135
}
```

Student CSV import/export columns:

```txt
id,studentName,phone,enabled
```

Student ID behavior:

- `studentDocId` is the Firestore document ID, not a field stored inside the student document.
- The section admin student create/edit form shows `studentDocId` as `Student ID`.
- When creating a student, a blank `Student ID` creates a new document with an auto-generated Firestore ID.
- When creating a student with a custom `Student ID`, the app writes `/classSections/{sectionId}/students/{studentDocId}` with `setDoc`.
- Existing student IDs are shown as read-only while editing; edits update the existing document instead of renaming or moving it.
- CSV import uses the `id` column as `studentDocId` when present, and creates an auto-ID document when `id` is blank.

### `qb_questions_v1`

Path:

```txt
/qb_questions_v1/{questionId}
```

Admin-relevant fields:

```js
{
  type: 'mcq',
  sectionId: 'classSections document id',
  classId: 'class_ix',
  subjectId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics',
  chapterId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics__chapter_algebra',
  topicId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics__chapter_algebra__topic_polynomials',
  difficulty: 'Easy',
  status: 'published',
  verified: true,
  promptHtml: '<p>Question text</p>',
  options: [{ html: 'Option text', correct: true }],
  fibBanks: [{ label: 'Blank 1', answers: ['answer'] }],
  trueAnswer: true,
  shortAnswerHtml: '<p>Model answer</p>',
  explanation: 'Teacher-facing explanation text',
  explanationUrl: 'https://example.com/explanation',
  explanationParameters: 'a=2&b=-5&c=3',
  hints: ['First nudge for the student', 'Second, more specific nudge'],
  skill: 'Listening',
  actfl_level: 'Novice Low',
  actfl_sublevel: 'Low',
  actfl_mode: 'Interpretive',
  translations: {
    Telugu: { question: '', options: [''], answer: '', explanation: '' }
  },
  authorUid: 'firebase-auth-uid',
  authorName: 'Teacher Name',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

Admin moderation:

- Questions can be filtered by search, status, verified state, minimum likes, and minimum dislikes.
- Like/dislike counts are computed from `qb_reactions_v1`.
- Bulk verified actions set `verified` to `true` or `false`.
- Bulk delete hard deletes selected question documents after a detailed confirmation preview.
- Questions can be filtered by `type`, and the correct answer column reads `options[].correct`, `shortAnswerHtml`, `trueAnswer`, or `fibBanks[].answers` depending on type.
- Questions can be filtered by whether `explanation` is present or missing, or by "With Hindi & Telugu translations" (English explanation plus `translations.Hindi.explanation` and `translations.Telugu.explanation`).
- Questions can be filtered by whether `hints` has at least one non-blank hint.
- Questions can be filtered by complete translations: at least one non-English entry in `translations`, and every such entry has a `question` (or `prompt`), `answer` (or `correctAnswer`), and `explanation` (MCQ `options` are not required). Anything else counts as incomplete or missing.
- The Questions moderation page populates its SECTION filter from distinct, non-empty `sectionId` values in the loaded questions and combines the selected value with the other filters.
- Questions can be filtered by whether `explanationUrl` is present or missing, or by "Has URL with parameters" (both `explanationUrl` and `explanationParameters` are non-blank). When present, the admin table shows it as an external link.
- Questions can be filtered and sorted by `skill`, `actfl_level`, `actfl_sublevel`, and `actfl_mode`.
- `skill` stores the LSRW skill. Supported admin filter/import values are `Listening`, `Speaking`, `Reading`, and `Writing`.
- `actfl_level` stores the proficiency level. Supported admin filter/import values are `Novice Low`, `Novice Mid`, `Novice High`, `Intermediate Low`, `Intermediate Mid`, `Intermediate High`, `Advanced Low`, `Advanced Mid`, `Advanced High`, `Superior`, and `Distinguished`.
- `actfl_sublevel` stores `Low`, `Mid`, or `High`; leave blank for `Superior` or `Distinguished`.
- `actfl_mode` stores `Interpersonal`, `Interpretive`, or `Presentational`.
- Question CSV export labels these columns as `Explanations` and `Explanation URL`. Import normalizes headers, so `explanation`, `explanations`, `explanationUrl`, or `explanation_url` map to the same Firestore fields.
- Question CSV import writes `translations.Hindi` and `translations.Telugu` fields from `Hindi Question`, `Hindi Options` (split on `|`), `Hindi Answer`, `Hindi Explanation` and the matching Telugu columns, using field paths so other fields are untouched; blank cells are skipped. `scripts/split-translations.js` converts a JSON `Translations` column into these columns.
- `explanationParameters` is an optional query string for the explanation URL, stored without the leading `?` (for example `a=2&b=-5&c=3`). The admin table shows it in a `Parameters` column next to `Explanation URL`, without filtering or sorting, with an **Open** link that opens `explanationUrl` joined to the parameters with `?` (or `&` when the URL already has a query string). CSV export uses the `Parameters` header; import accepts `Parameters` or `explanationParameters`, strips a leading `?`, rejects values containing spaces, and a blank cell clears the field.
- `hints` is an ordered list of student-facing hints. CSV export joins them with ` | ` under a `Hints` column; import splits on `|` (header `Hint` or `Hints`) and replaces the whole list.
- Question CSV import/export also supports `skill`, `actfl_level`, `actfl_sublevel`, and `actfl_mode`. Import normalizes headers, so variants like `LSRW skill` and `actflLevel` are accepted.
- The Student Records page reads `classId`, `subjectId`, `verified`, `options`, and `shortAnswerHtml` to label and filter submitted answers.

### `qb_taxonomy_v1`

Path:

```txt
/qb_taxonomy_v1/{taxonomyId}
```

Admin-relevant fields:

```js
{
  type: 'class' | 'subject' | 'chapter' | 'topic',
  label: 'Polynomials',
  parentId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics__chapter_algebra',
  classId: 'class_ix',
  subjectId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics',
  chapterId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics__chapter_algebra',
  topicId: 'class_ix__subject_mathematics__chapter_algebra__topic_polynomials',
  verified: true,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

Admin moderation:

- Taxonomy can be filtered by search, type, and verified state.
- Taxonomy CSV export/import uses `id,type,label,parentId,verified`. The taxonomy `type` determines whether the single `id` maps to `classId`, `subjectId`, `chapterId`, or `topicId` internally.
- Taxonomy CSV import accepts pasted CSV or a CSV file, shows a detailed preview, then upserts with merge.
- Bulk verified actions set `verified` to `true` or `false`.
- Bulk delete hard deletes selected taxonomy documents after a detailed confirmation preview.
- Merge supports two-column mapping from selected source taxonomy rows to target taxonomy rows. The source and target columns have separate include search, exclude search, and verified-state filters.
- Each merge mapping requires the source and target taxonomy items to have the same `type`. A selected target row is kept when another selected source maps into it.
- Merge rewrites questions that reference each old source taxonomy ID, then deletes the old source taxonomy document.
- The question field updated during merge is based on taxonomy `type`: `classId`, `subjectId`, `chapterId`, or `topicId`.

### `qb_lists_v1`

Path:

```txt
/qb_lists_v1/{listId}
```

Document shape:

```js
{
  name: 'Favorites',
  ownerUid: 'firebase-auth-uid',
  questionIds: [
    'qb_questions_v1 document id'
  ],
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

Important fields:

- `ownerUid` - must match the signed-in teacher UID for the list to appear in the classroom editor.
- `name` - shown in the classroom question-list dropdown.
- `questionIds` - stores question document IDs, not embedded question snapshots.

### `qb_quiz_submissions_v1`

Path:

```txt
/qb_quiz_submissions_v1/{submissionId}
```

Document shape:

```js
{
  classroomId: '176260',
  sectionId: 'QQAP9O4UyvlaYhqz7jdE',
  admissionNo: '102',
  studentName: 'Parunandi Sai Adithya',
  studentKey: 'QQAP9O4UyvlaYhqz7jdE_102',

  className: 'IX',
  subject: 'Mathematics',
  chapters: ['Algebra', 'Polynomials'],
  difficulty: 'Easy',

  questionCount: 10,
  answeredCount: 8,
  gradableCount: 7,
  correctCount: 5,

  answers: [
    {
      questionId: 'question-doc-id',
      type: 'mcq',
      promptHtml: '<p>Question snapshot</p>',
      displayAnswer: 'Option A',
      isCorrect: true,
      correctAnswer: 'Option A',
      selectedOptions: [0],
      fibAnswers: [],
      trueFalseAnswer: null,
      shortAnswer: ''
    }
  ],

  submittedAt: Timestamp,
  submittedAtMillis: 1788264300000
}
```

Important fields:

- `classroomId` - used to load submissions for the selected classroom.
- `sectionId` - used as a fallback to load all student submissions for a classroom section.
- `studentKey` - `${sectionId}_${admissionNo}`.
- `answers` - contains question snapshots and student answer snapshots for detailed review.
- `isCorrect` - `true` or `false` for auto-graded items, `null` for short-answer/manual-review items.
- `submittedAtMillis` - used for newest-first client sorting.

## Query Patterns

Classroom list:

```txt
classrooms where creatorId == currentUser.uid
```

Classroom admin list:

```txt
classrooms
```

Submission admin list:

```txt
qb_quiz_submissions_v1
classrooms
```

The submissions admin page associates submissions to classrooms by document ID, class code, then section ID fallback. Its date filter defaults to today's local date and checks `submittedAtMillis`, falling back to `submittedAt` when needed.

Question admin list:

```txt
qb_questions_v1
qb_reactions_v1
```

Taxonomy admin list:

```txt
qb_taxonomy_v1
qb_questions_v1
```

Question list dropdown:

```txt
qb_lists_v1 where ownerUid == currentUser.uid
```

Section dropdown:

```txt
classSections
```

Section roster:

```txt
classSections/{sectionId}/students
```

Submission loading for a selected classroom:

```txt
qb_quiz_submissions_v1 where classroomId == classroom.id
qb_quiz_submissions_v1 where classroomId == classroom.classCode
qb_quiz_submissions_v1 where sectionId == classroom.sectionId
```

The app de-duplicates submissions by document ID and sorts by `submittedAtMillis` newest first.

## Suggested Indexes

```txt
classrooms:
  creatorId ASC

qb_lists_v1:
  ownerUid ASC

qb_quiz_submissions_v1:
  classroomId ASC

qb_quiz_submissions_v1:
  sectionId ASC
```

If sorting is moved into Firestore later:

```txt
qb_quiz_submissions_v1:
  classroomId ASC
  submittedAtMillis DESC

qb_quiz_submissions_v1:
  sectionId ASC
  submittedAtMillis DESC
```

## Security Notes

The cleanest production rule is to write a teacher ownership field into each submission:

```js
{
  teacherUid: 'teacher-auth-uid'
}
```

Then dashboard reads can be restricted with:

```txt
request.auth.uid == resource.data.teacherUid
```

Without `teacherUid`, rules can authorize `classroomId` reads when `classroomId` matches an actual classroom document ID. Section-level fallback reads are harder to secure in Firestore rules because rules cannot query for "a classroom owned by this teacher with this sectionId." In that case, prefer adding `teacherUid` to submissions in the quiz-taking app.

## Authenticated student profiles

Roster records remain at `classSections/{sectionId}/students/{studentDocId}` and add `email`, `username` (same as email), `admissionNo`, `authUid`, and `studentKey`. The trusted account backend maintains `studentProfiles/{authUid}` for direct student login lookup. See [Student Auth Deployment](STUDENT_AUTH_DEPLOYMENT.md) for the profile schema, migration, access rules, and rollout requirements. Passwords must never appear in Firestore.
